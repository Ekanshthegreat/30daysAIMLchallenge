learnt what AGI is: 

Deep Learning: an AI discipline that focuses on training neural networks with multiple hidden layers to extract and understand complex relationships from raw data


Generative artificial intelligence: is a subset of deep learning wherein an AI system can produce unique and realistic content from learned knowledge
its trained with massive data sets.

Natural language processing (NLP): is a branch of AI that allows computer systems to understand and generate human language. language data into simple representations called tokens and understand their contextual relationship

Computer vision:  technology that allows systems to extract, analyze, and comprehend spatial information from visual data. Self-driving cars use computer vision models to analyze real-time feeds from cameras and navigate the vehicle safely away from obstacles. Deep learning technologies allow computer vision systems to automate large-scale object recognition, classification, monitoring, and other image-processing tasks.
